        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Massaman curry is a fusion of Thai- and Indian-style curries, utilizing both a red-style curry paste (Thai influence) and dry whole spices like cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and nutmeg (Indian influence). Another essential ingredient is roasted peanuts, which add an extra layer of richness and texture to the curry.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 lb shrimp</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp cocnut oil</li>
                <li>1 tsp whole cumin seed</li>
                <li>1 tsp whole corriander seed</li>
                <li>5 Tbsp red curry paste</li>
                <li>1.5 cups baby potatoes cut into bite size pieces</li>
                <li>2 large carrots peeled and diced</li>
                <li>2 14-oz cans light fat cocunut milk</li>
                <li>1.5 cups water</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 dash ea caramom and nutmeg</li>
                <li>2-3 Tbsp coconut aminos</li>
                <li>1-2 Tbsp maple syrup</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp peanut butter</li>
                <li>1-2 Tbsp lime juice</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large pot or dutch oven, over medium heat. Once hot, add oil (or water) and shallot. Sauté 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Turn down heat if browning too quickly.</li>
                <li>Add whole cumin and coriander seeds (or powder) and sauté for another 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently. Then add red curry paste and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute more.</li>
                <li>Add potatoes and carrots and stir to coat. Cook for 2 minutes. Then add coconut milk, water (starting with the lesser amount), cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, coconut aminos, maple syrup, and peanut butter. (Reserve lime juice for later).</li>
                <li>The liquid should cover all of the ingredients — if it does not, add a bit more coconut milk or water to cover. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Once it reaches a low boil, reduce heat to a simmer (add meat at this time if cooking with shrimp or chicken) and cook for 10-15 minutes uncovered. You don’t want it boiling, so ensure it’s cooking over low heat at a simmer. </li>
                <li>Add lime in the last few minutes of cooking and stir. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lime for acidity, salt or coconut aminos for saltiness, curry paste for heat / more intense curry taste, maple syrup for sweetness, cinnamon or nutmeg for warmth, or peanut butter for creaminess / more intense peanut flavor. Stir and cook a few minutes more. Then turn off heat and let stand for at least 5 minutes before serving (this allows the flavors to meld).</li>    
                <li>To serve, divide between serving bowls and enjoy as is or with a side of rice, cauliflower rice, quinoa, or steamed greens (optional). Fresh lime juice, cilantro, and roasted peanuts (optional) make lovely additions as well.</li>
            </ol>
